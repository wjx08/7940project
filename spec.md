According to the project requirements, what our team intends to do is the LINE chatbot. We want to realize that users can meet their basic understanding of the data related to the Coronavirus disease through interaction with the chatbot. For example, when you want to know the epidemic situation in a specific area, you enter a specific area, and the chatbot will respond to the changes in the number of new coronary pneumonia diagnosed in the area in the past ten days. What way to show it, a line chart or a bar chart, is still uncertain. In addition, when you want to know the specific situation of the national epidemic on a specific date, you enter a specific date, and the chatbot can reply national data for that day, including the cumulative number of diagnoses, the number of confirmed diagnoses, the cumulative deaths, and the cumulative number of cures , death cure ratio and so on. This is what our team wants to achieve with the chatbot. I hope that we can guarantee the quality and quantity and realize them one by one. If there are any changes, they will also be reflected in further milestones.
